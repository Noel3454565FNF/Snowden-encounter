The thingy that triggers the rainbow eyesore.

Works in a different way compared to the OG
eyesore, and acts more like a enhanced version of
Blammed Lights.

Will NOT work if "Flashing Lights" being off. When this
happens, a message will appear on the top-left corner.

Fade off time is based on the current BPM.
Algorithm: 2 / curBpm * 50

Value 1: Function time, in seconds.
Value 2: Flashing speed. Recommended Value is: 1.5.
